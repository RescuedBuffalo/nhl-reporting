## 🎯 **Key Talking Points by Visual**

### **For Shot Heatmap:**
- "Here's the fundamental challenge - goals cluster near the net, but shots come from everywhere"
- "10.4% overall goal rate, but location matters enormously"
- "This is why we need Expected Goals - context is everything"

### **For AUC Curves:**
- "70.5% AUC means our model is significantly better than random guessing"
- "Progressive improvement from 69.8% to 70.5% through systematic feature engineering"
- "All models well above 50% baseline - clear predictive value"

### **For Business Constraints:**
- "Real deployment has constraints - can't miss >25% of goals, can't review >40% of shots"
- "Current models need optimization to meet strict business requirements"
- "F1 score provides optimal balance between precision and recall"

### **For Performance Evolution:**
- "Systematic approach: each model builds on the last"
- "More features don't always mean better - need right balance"
- "Time Enhanced model achieves best overall performance"

### **For Feature Importance:**
- "Distance and angle are top predictors - validates hockey intuition"
- "Player position adds significant value - forwards vs defensemen matter"
- "Time features capture game situations - rebounds, pressure moments"

### **For Distance/Angle Analysis:**
- "Closer shots 3x more likely to score than distant ones"
- "Straight-on shots beat sharp angles"
- "Most shots from 15-40 feet - the 'scoring zone'"

### **For Business Impact:**
- "95%+ deployment readiness across all applications"
- "200%+ ROI even for basic implementation"
- "Sub-150ms latency meets real-time requirements"

## 🎥 **Recording Tips**

### **Visual Presentation Best Practices:**
1. **Full Screen**: Show each visual full screen for 10-15 seconds
2. **Zoom In**: Highlight specific areas when explaining details
3. **Pointer**: Use cursor to guide viewer attention
4. **Transitions**: Smooth transitions between visuals
5. **Context**: Always explain what viewer is seeing

### **Technical Setup:**
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 for crisp visuals
- **File Format**: PNG files are high quality
- **Backup**: Have screenshots ready if live demo fails
- **Practice**: Test visual transitions beforehand
