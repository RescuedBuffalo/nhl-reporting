# NHL Expected Goals (xG) Modeling: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach to Real-Time Shot Success Prediction

## Abstract

This study develops a comprehensive machine learning system to predict NHL shot success and calculate Expected Goals (xG) using historical NHL event data. The project addresses critical challenges in sports analytics including temporal validation, streaming compatibility, business constraint optimization, and real-time deployment considerations. Through analysis of 18,470 shots from 274 NHL games, we developed a 41-feature streaming-safe model achieving 75.5% goal detection with 24.5% miss rate, meeting business deployment criteria. Key contributions include a novel streaming compatibility framework, dual-constraint optimization methodology, and business threshold analysis that bridges machine learning performance with operational requirements.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Expected Goals (xG) modeling represents a fundamental challenge in hockey analytics: predicting the probability that a shot will result in a goal based on situational factors available at the time of the shot. Unlike post-hoc analysis, real-time xG modeling requires features that are immediately available when a shot occurs, creating unique constraints for feature engineering and model deployment.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. **Develop streaming-compatible xG models** with sub-150ms prediction latency
2. **Establish proper temporal validation** methodology for sports time-series data
3. **Create business constraint framework** balancing goal detection with operational efficiency
4. **Implement dual-constraint optimization** for α (miss rate) and β (review rate) constraints
5. **Demonstrate production deployment readiness** with comprehensive evaluation

### 1.3 Significance

This research addresses critical gaps in sports analytics methodology, particularly the challenge of deploying machine learning models in real-time environments while meeting business operational constraints. The streaming compatibility framework and dual-constraint optimization methodology have broad applications beyond hockey analytics.
