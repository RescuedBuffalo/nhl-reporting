About the Final Project
For the final project, you will identify an Unsupervised Learning problem to perform EDA and model analysis.  The project has 140 total points. In the instructions is a summary of the criteria you will use to guide your submission and review others’ submissions.   You will submit three deliverables:

Deliverable 1 

A Jupyter notebook showing an Unsupervised Learning problem description, EDA procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion. 

Suppose your work becomes so large that it doesn’t fit into one notebook (or you think it will be less readable by having one large notebook). In that case, you can make several notebooks or scripts in a GitHub repository (as deliverable 3) and submit a report-style notebook or pdf instead.

If your project doesn't fit into Jupyter notebook format, write your approach as a report and submit it in a pdf form.

Deliverable 2 

A video presentation or demo of your work. The presentation should be a condensed version as if you're doing a short pitch to advertise your work, so please focus on the highlights:

What problem do you solve?

What ML approach do you use, or what methods does your app use?

Show the result or run an app demo.

The minimum video length is 5 min, the maximum length is 15 min. The recommended length is about 10 min. Submit the video in .mp4 format.

Deliverable 3 

A public project GitHub repository with your work (please also include the GitHub repo URL in your notebook/report and slides). 

Data byproduct

If your project creates data and you want to share it, an excellent way to share would be through a Kaggle dataset or similar. Similarly, suppose you want to make your video public. In that case, we recommend uploading it to YouTube or similar and posting the link(s) to your repository or blog instead of a direct upload to GitHub. It is generally a good practice not to upload big files to a Git repository.

Drops, Refunds, and Withdrawals
You may drop this course with a 100% refund within 14 days of your class start date or your enrollment date (whichever is later) as long as long as you have not accessed restricted content (e.g., password quiz, honor code verification, final exam/project, etc.) or received a grade. When a course is dropped under these conditions, it will not appear on your record.  You can withdraw after the 14 days as long as you have not accessed restricted content or received a grade. When a student withdraws under these conditions, they will receive a grade of W on their academic record. Visit the CU Boulder Registrar's
