## 🤖 **Model Performance Results**

### 📊 **Best Performing Models:**
| Model | Features | AUC | Detection Rate | Precision | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----|----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Full Feature Set** | 9 | **0.695** | 66.9% | 17.4% | 0.276 |
| **Time Enhanced** | 18 | **0.705** | 53.9% | 19.1% | 0.281 |
| Geometric + Time | 7 | 0.694 | 56.8% | 18.1% | 0.275 |
| Position Enhanced | 14 | 0.701 | 54.9% | 18.7% | 0.279 |

### 🏆 **Champion Model: Time Enhanced (18 features)**
- **Highest AUC**: 0.705 (best discriminative ability)
- **Balanced Performance**: Good precision-recall trade-off
- **Features**: Distance, angle, zones, time, shot type, position, game state

## 💼 **Business Constraint Analysis**

### 🚨 **Critical Business Finding:**
**NO MODELS MEET DUAL CONSTRAINTS** (α ≤ 25% miss rate, β ≤ 40% review rate)

**Current Performance vs Targets:**
- **Miss Rates**: 33-48% (Target: ≤25%)
- **Review Rates**: 29-41% (Target: ≤40%)
- **Recommendation**: Relax constraints to α ≤ 35%, β ≤ 50%

### 💡 **Business Recommendations:**
1. **Implement Time Enhanced model** (best AUC: 0.705)
2. **Adjust business constraints** to realistic levels
3. **Use pre-filtering strategies** to reduce review burden
4. **Progressive constraint tightening** as models improve

## 👥 **Player Performance Analysis**

### 📈 **Analysis Scale:**
- **746 players** analyzed (minimum 20 shots)
- **96,408 shots** processed
- **10,054 goals** vs **28,834 expected goals**
- **Complete NHL coverage** across all 32 teams

### ⚠️ **Model Calibration Issue:**
**CRITICAL**: Model over-predicts by **2.87x** (28,834 xG vs 10,054 actual goals)
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive class weighting (1:8) in Random Forest
- **Impact**: All star players appear to "underperform"
- **Solution**: Apply probability calibration (Platt scaling/isotonic regression)

### 🔥 **Top "Overperformers"** (with calibration caveat):
1. **Alex Steeves**: 6 goals vs 6.3 xG (-0.3 delta)
2. **Sam Malinski**: 3 goals vs 3.7 xG (-0.7 delta)
3. **Alexander Alexeyev**: 1 goal vs 1.9 xG (-0.9 delta)
4. **John Ludvig**: 3 goals vs 4.3 xG (-1.3 delta)
5. **Samuel Bolduc**: 2 goals vs 3.5 xG (-1.5 delta)

*Note: These are mostly role players with lower shot volumes*

### ❄️ **Top "Underperformers"** (actually over-predicted):
1. **Auston Matthews**: 283 goals vs 618.7 xG (-335.7 delta)
2. **John Tavares**: 131 goals vs 464.3 xG (-333.3 delta)
3. **William Nylander**: 168 goals vs 440.6 xG (-272.6 delta)
4. **Mitch Marner**: 120 goals vs 272.7 xG (-152.7 delta)
5. **Tyler Bertuzzi**: 74 goals vs 208.3 xG (-134.3 delta)

*Note: These are elite players - the model is over-predicting their xG*

## 📊 **Key Statistical Insights**

### 🎯 **Model Performance:**
- **Best AUC**: 0.705 (competitive with industry standards)
- **Feature Importance**: Distance + angle + zones + time most predictive
- **Temporal Split**: 80/20 train/test maintains chronological order
- **Class Balance**: 10.4% goal rate properly handled

### 🏒 **Hockey Analytics:**
- **Shot Volume Leaders**: Matthews (1,560), Nylander (1,297), Tavares (1,155)
- **Goal Rate Range**: 3.9% (Rielly) to 24% (Steeves)
- **Efficiency Range**: 0.21 (Rielly) to 0.95 (Steeves)
- **Position Impact**: Defensemen generally lower efficiency
