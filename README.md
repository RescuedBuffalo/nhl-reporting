# NHL Expected Goals (xG) Modeling Project üèí

## üìã Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive machine learning system to predict NHL shot success and calculate Expected Goals (xG) using historical NHL event data. The project demonstrates advanced techniques in sports analytics, temporal validation, business constraint optimization, and real-time deployment considerations.

**üéØ Academic Deliverables:**
- **Deliverable 1**: Jupyter notebook with EDA, model analysis, and results (see `src/analysis/nhl_xg_analysis.ipynb`)
- **Deliverable 2**: Video presentation/demo (see `PRESENTATION_SCRIPT.md` and `PRESENTATION_READY.md`)
- **Deliverable 3**: Public GitHub repository with complete work

## üéØ Project Goals

### Primary Objective
