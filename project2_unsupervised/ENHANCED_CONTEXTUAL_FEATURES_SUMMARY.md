### ‚è∞ **Enhanced Fatigue & Time Features (8 features)** - *NEW*

#### **Fatigue Patterns**:
- `time_remaining_period` - Seconds left in current period (0-1200)
- `time_remaining_game` - Seconds left in regulation (0-3600) 
- `high_fatigue_shot` - Shot when <5 minutes left in period (0/1)
- `fresh_legs_shot` - Shot when >15 minutes left in period (0/1)
- `period_fatigue_encoded` - Fatigue level: very_tired, tired, moderate, fresh

#### **Enhanced Time Pressure**:
- `final_two_minutes` - Final 2 minutes of 3rd period (0/1)

### üö® **Special Teams Situations (3 features)** - *NEW*

#### **Game Situations**:
- `on_power_play` - Team has man advantage (0/1)
- `on_penalty_kill` - Team is short-handed (0/1) 
- `even_strength` - Equal strength play (0/1)

**Special Teams Detection Logic**:
```python
# Based on NHL situation codes (AABB format)
# 1551 = 5v5 even strength
# 1541 = 5v4 power play  
# 1451 = 4v5 penalty kill
# etc.
```

- `player_previous_goals` - Goals scored in previous season
- `player_previous_shots` - Total shots in previous season  
- `player_previous_shooting_pct` - Shooting percentage from previous season
- `player_has_history` - Whether player has previous season data (0/1)

#### **Player Scoring Tiers**:
- `player_scoring_tier_encoded` - Categorical scoring ability:
  - `elite_scorer` - 30+ goals previous season
  - `good_scorer` - 20-29 goals previous season  
  - `average_scorer` - 10-19 goals previous season
  - `low_scorer` - 1-9 goals previous season
  - `non_scorer` - 0 goals but played previous season
  - `no_history` - Player exists but no previous season data
  - `unknown` - No player data available

### üïê **Enhanced Contextual Timing (7 features)**

- `period_timing_encoded` - When in period (start, middle, end)

#### **Enhanced Time Pressure**:
- `time_pressure_encoded` - Pressure level:
  - `regular_time` - Normal game flow
  - `period_start_fresh` - First 2 minutes (fresh legs)
  - `period_end_tired` - Final 5 minutes (tired legs)
  - `final_minutes` - Final 2 minutes of 3rd period
  - `overtime` - Overtime periods

## Business Value of Enhanced Features

### **Special Teams Intelligence**
- **"Power play specialists"** - Players/zones that excel with man advantage
- **"Penalty kill threats"** - Dangerous short-handed opportunities  
- **"Even strength workhorses"** - Consistent 5v5 production

### **Fatigue Analytics** 
- **"Fresh legs advantage"** - Early period/game performance patterns
- **"Tired legs liability"** - Late period/game performance drops
- **"Clutch performers"** - Players who maintain effectiveness when tired
- **"Endurance patterns"** - How shot quality changes with fatigue

### **Player Pedigree Analysis**
- **"Elite scorer zones"** - Where top scorers take their shots
- **"Development opportunities"** - Zones where non-scorers can improve
- **"Veteran experience"** - How player history affects shot selection
- **"Unknown quantities"** - New players without scoring history

### **Advanced Game Situations**
- **"Pressure performance"** - How players perform in clutch moments
- **"Situational specialists"** - Players who excel in specific contexts
- **"Fatigue management"** - When to deploy key players for maximum effectiveness

## Sample Business Insights

### **Cluster Examples**:
1. **"Elite Power Play Snipers"** - High danger, power play, elite scorers, fresh legs
2. **"Penalty Kill Grinders"** - Medium danger, short-handed, average scorers, tired
3. **"Overtime Heroes"** - Various danger, overtime, good scorers, high pressure
4. **"Fresh Period Starters"** - High danger, period start, any scorer tier, fresh legs
5. **"Tired End-of-Period"** - Low danger, period end, any scorer, very tired
6. **"Clutch Final Minutes"** - High danger, final 2 minutes, elite scorers, high pressure

### **Strategic Applications**:
- **Line Deployment**: "Deploy elite scorers for power play opportunities in fresh situations"
- **Fatigue Management**: "Avoid high-danger situations when players are very tired"  
- **Special Teams**: "Focus penalty kill defense on these specific high-danger zones"
- **Player Development**: "Train non-scorers to take shots from elite scorer zones"
- **Game Management**: "These zones become more dangerous in overtime/final minutes"

## Technical Implementation
