## üö® 4. Critical Devil's Advocate Analysis

### **Methodological Concerns**

#### **Spatial Aggregation Risks**
- **Information loss**: 296 bins from 96,408 shots = significant compression
- **Arbitrary parameters**: 20x15 bin selection lacks theoretical justification
- **Over-smoothing**: May miss important spatial nuances

#### **Validation Issues**
- **Statistical significance**: P-value (0.024) above strict threshold (0.001)
- **Multiple testing**: No correction for multiple hypothesis testing
- **Overfitting risk**: Results may not generalize to new data

#### **Business Value Questions**
- **Correlation vs. causation**: Do clusters actually improve outcomes?
- **Domain knowledge**: Are we rediscovering known patterns?
- **Implementation complexity**: Is this more complex than the problem?

### **Alternative Explanations**
- **Player skill effects**: Elite players score from "low-danger" areas
- **Game context**: Power plays, empty nets, score differentials
- **Goalie effects**: Different save percentages by location
- **Arena differences**: Coordinate system inconsistencies

### **Rigorous Testing Recommendations**

#### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Sensitivity analysis**: Test different bin configurations
2. **Cross-validation**: Temporal and team-based splits
3. **Ablation studies**: Remove features to test robustness
4. **Domain expert review**: NHL coach/analyst validation

#### **Alternative Approaches**
- **Supervised learning**: Direct goal prediction
- **Hierarchical clustering**: Domain-knowledge driven
- **Ensemble methods**: Multiple algorithm combination
- **Rule-based systems**: Simple, interpretable heuristics
