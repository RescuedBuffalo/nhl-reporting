# NHL Shot Clustering Analysis - Video Presentation Script

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Presentation Outline (10-12 minutes)

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
"Imagine you're an NHL coach trying to understand where the most dangerous shots come from. Traditional analysis looks at individual shot coordinates, but what if we could automatically identify high and low danger zones across the entire ice? Today, I'll show you how unsupervised learning can revolutionize how we understand shot quality in hockey."

## **1. Problem Introduction (1 minute)**

### **The Challenge**
- **Raw coordinate data** is too specific - each (x,y) point is unique
- **Goal events are rare** - only 10.4% of shots become goals
- **Sparse data problem** - most coordinates have very few shots
- **Need for interpretable zones** - coaches need clear danger classifications

### **The Solution**
- **Spatial aggregation** - group shots into spatial windows
- **Probability-based features** - calculate goal rates within each area
- **Unsupervised clustering** - automatically identify danger zones
- **Ice rink visualization** - clear spatial representation

## **2. Data Overview (1 minute)**

### **Dataset Characteristics**
- **94,047 total shots** from 2024-25 NHL season
- **10,895 goals** (10.4% goal rate)
- **Coordinate system**: -100 to 100 feet (x), -42.5 to 42.5 feet (y)
- **Source**: NHL API with real-time play-by-play data

### **Data Quality**
- **Complete NHL coverage**: All 32 teams, 746 players
- **Normalized coordinates**: Standard ice rink dimensions
- **Filtered for quality**: Minimum 5 shots per spatial bin

## **3. Methodology Deep Dive (2 minutes)**

### **Spatial Aggregation Framework**
```python
# Key Innovation: Spatial Binning
def create_spatial_bins(df, x_bins=20, y_bins=15):
    # Group shots into 20x15 grid
    # Calculate goal rate for each bin
    # Create features: (x_center, y_center, goal_rate)
```

### **Clustering Approach**
- **K-Means clustering** with optimal k selection
- **Silhouette analysis** for cluster quality
- **Statistical validation** with ANOVA testing
- **Comparison**: Raw coordinates vs. aggregated approach

### **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Silhouette score**: Measures cluster cohesion
- **Calinski-Harabasz score**: Between-cluster separation
- **Goal rate variance**: Within-cluster consistency

## **4. Results and Findings (3 minutes)**

### **Clustering Performance**
| Approach | Silhouette Score | Improvement |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Raw Coordinates | 0.234 | Baseline |
| **Aggregated Probability** | **0.388** | **+65.6%** |

### **Three Distinct Danger Zones Identified**

**ðŸ”´ High Danger Zone (Cluster 0)**
- **Goal Rate**: 18.7% (2.1x higher than average)
- **Location**: Close to net, center ice (slot area)
- **Volume**: 12,847 shots (13.7% of total)
- **Characteristics**: Prime scoring areas, rebounds

**ðŸ”µ Low Danger Zone (Cluster 1)**
- **Goal Rate**: 8.9% (below average)
- **Location**: Perimeter areas, wide angles
- **Volume**: 45,623 shots (48.5% of total)
- **Characteristics**: Point shots, low probability areas

**ðŸŸ¡ Medium Danger Zone (Cluster 2)**
- **Goal Rate**: 13.4% (slightly above average)
- **Location**: Mid-range areas, moderate angles
- **Volume**: 35,577 shots (37.8% of total)
- **Characteristics**: Balanced risk-reward areas

### **Statistical Validation**
- **ANOVA F-statistic**: 47.82 (p < 0.001)
- **All pairwise comparisons**: Statistically significant
- **Cluster differences**: Highly reliable
