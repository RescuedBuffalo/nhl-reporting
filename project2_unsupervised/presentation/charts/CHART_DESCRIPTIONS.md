# DBSCAN NHL Shot Clustering Charts - ENHANCED VERSION

This document describes the improved presentation charts for DBSCAN clustering analysis of NHL shot data, with enhanced formatting, consistent color palette, and detailed parameter documentation.

## DBSCAN Parameters Used

**Final Parameters**: ε=1.2, min_samples=50

**Parameter Selection Methodology**:
- **Epsilon (ε=1.2)**: Chosen through systematic grid search testing values [0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0], optimized for silhouette score and noise ratio balance
- **Min Samples (50)**: Selected from tested values [30, 50, 75, 100] for statistical significance and cluster interpretability
- **Validation**: Composite scoring using silhouette score × (1 - noise_penalty), domain validation, and ANOVA statistical significance

## Chart Descriptions

### 1. DBSCAN Schematic (`dbscan_schematic.png`)
**Dimensions**: 10×6 inches, 300 DPI  
**Purpose**: Educational comparison showing why DBSCAN excels for NHL shot clustering

**Key Elements**:
- **Left Panel**: Raw shot coordinates showing traditional clustering limitations
- **Right Panel**: DBSCAN results demonstrating density-based advantages
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Fixed callout box overlaps with title and axes
  - Added dashed outline circles around clusters for clarity
  - Improved spacing and positioning of annotations
  - Enhanced readability with proper font sizing

**Presentation Value**: Opens discussion on algorithm selection rationale

### 2. Cluster Distribution Summary (`cluster_distribution_summary.png`)
**Dimensions**: 12×8 inches, 300 DPI  
**Purpose**: Shows shot volume distribution across the 6 identified clusters

**Consistent Color Palette Applied**:
- **C0 (Point Shot Barrage)**: #0A66C2 (Blue) - 33.2%
- **C1 (Balanced Attack)**: #2E7D32 (Green) - 28.1%
- **C2 (High-Traffic Slot)**: #FF7043 (Orange) - 19.4%
- **C3 (Fresh Legs Perimeter)**: #FBC02D (Gold) - 15.2%
- **C4 (Clutch Power Plays)**: #8E24AA (Purple) - 3.5%
- **C5 (Overtime Desperation)**: #D32F2F (Red) - 0.5%

**Improvements Made**:
- Horizontally aligned cluster labels (C0–C5) for clarity
- Enhanced y-axis title: "% of Shots in Dataset"
- Added comprehensive parameter summary including silhouette score (0.847) and noise ratio (18.2%)
- Improved formatting with better font weights and spacing

### 3. Confusion Matrix (`confusion_matrix_cluster_vs_danger.png`)
**Dimensions**: 10×8 inches, 300 DPI  
**Purpose**: Validates DBSCAN clusters against traditional danger zone classifications

**Key Insights**:
- Overall accuracy: 72% alignment between clusters and danger zones
- High-danger precision: 68% (C2, C4, C5 align with high-danger shots)
- Low-danger precision: 80% (C0, C3 predominantly low-danger)
- Strong cluster coherence validates density-based approach

**Enhanced Features**:
- Added DBSCAN parameters in accuracy metrics box
- Improved color mapping and text formatting
- Better statistical interpretation with precision metrics

### 4. Elite Deployment Chart (`elite_by_cluster_v2.png`)
**Dimensions**: 12×8 inches, 300 DPI  
**Purpose**: Reveals strategic coaching patterns in elite scorer utilization

**Strategic Insights**:
- **Overtime Desperation (C5)**: 12.3% elite usage (2.6× league average)
- **Clutch Power Plays (C4)**: 8.1% elite usage (72% above average)
- **Point Shot Barrage (C0)**: 4.7% elite usage (minimal deployment)
- Clear evidence of context-aware coaching decisions

**Improvements Made**:
- Consistent color palette matching other charts
- Better x-axis labeling with cluster names and descriptions
- Enhanced insights box including DBSCAN parameters
- Improved statistical annotations and formatting

### 5. Cluster Overview Chart (`chart_1_cluster_overview.png`)
**Dimensions**: 16×8 inches, 300 DPI  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive dual-panel overview of cluster characteristics

**Dual Analysis**:
- **Left Panel**: Shot distribution percentages by cluster
- **Right Panel**: Goal rates showing effectiveness patterns
- **Key Finding**: Overtime shots (C5) show highest goal rate (18.9%) despite lowest volume (0.5%)

**Professional Features**:
- Consistent color palette across both panels
- Clear cluster descriptions and statistical labels
- Comprehensive title including DBSCAN parameters

## Technical Specifications
