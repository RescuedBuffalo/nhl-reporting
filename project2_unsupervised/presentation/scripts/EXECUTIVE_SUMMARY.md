- Challenges conventional wisdom about player management
- Creates new strategic opportunities in clutch situations
- **Business Impact**: Reframe fatigue as a tactical advantage

### ⭐ **Elite Scorer Strategic Deployment** 
**Elite players are deployed 72% more in clutch power plays vs point shots** (8.1% vs 4.7%)
- Reveals sophisticated coaching decision patterns hidden in data
- Quantifies star talent optimization strategies
- **Business Impact**: Data-driven elite player utilization

### ⚡ **Overtime Revolution**
**Overtime shots score at 33.9% rate** (3.28x league average)
- 3-on-3 creates fundamentally different game dynamics
- Fresh legs deployment critical for OT success
- **Business Impact**: Specialized overtime systems and deployment

## The 6 Shot Archetypes (Business Ready)

1. **🔴 Overtime Desperation** (0.5% shots, 33.9% goals) - *The Game Deciders*
2. **🔴 High-Traffic Slot** (19.4% shots, 17.7% goals) - *The Bread-and-Butter*
3. **🟡 Clutch Time Power Plays** (3.5% shots, 20.2% goals) - *The Pressure Cooker*
