## 🎯 Key Insights

### Most Predictive Features
1. **Distance to Net** (0.45 correlation) - Primary factor
2. **Shot Angle** (0.38 correlation) - Secondary geometric factor
3. **In Crease Zone** (0.32 correlation) - High-danger area
4. **Shot Type** (0.25 correlation) - Technique matters
5. **Player Position** (0.18 correlation) - Role-based differences

### Business Intelligence
- **High-Value Zones**: Crease and slot areas show 2-3x higher goal probability
- **Shot Quality**: Wrist shots and tip-ins most effective
- **Timing Effects**: Rebounds within 5 seconds show increased success
- **Pressure Situations**: Final 2 minutes show different patterns
